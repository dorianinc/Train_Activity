<img src="assets/images/traintime.jpg">

<p>Heres how the App works:</p><br>
<p>You can add trains with the following info: Train Name Destination First Train Time -- in military time Frequency -- in minutes</p><br>
<p>This app will calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.</p><br>
<p>Using Firebase users from many different machines will be able to view the same train times.</p><br>
